# Why Linggen

## Linggen helps individuals and teams use AI coding tools better and faster — by absorbing complexity (MCP, skills, prompts, tools) and turning it into simple, repeatable workflows.

## Linggen is a cross-AI infrastructure tool. You can use Claude, Google, Cursor, or multiple tools together. Your skills, prompts, and workflows live in one place and are easy to share across projects and teams.

## Linggen anchors code to memory. Notes, decisions, tiny tips, or logs stay close to the code they belong to — not lost in chats, docs, or commit messages.
